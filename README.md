#### Project Description:
The goal of this project was to create a web application that can recognize and categorize fruits and vegetables from uploaded photographs using a machine learning model and Python tools. We verify the quantity in the inventory in the firebase after identifying the image. For seamless connectivity, ngrok integration is employed, and Firebase is used for effective data storage. Users can upload photographs, receive precise identification results, and access the stored data online using the application's user-friendly interface. This research provides a cutting-edge method for utilizing online and machine learning technologies for effective inventory management and vegetable and fruit identification.
